# Image Caption Generator
Image caption generator is a task that involves computer vision and natural language processing concepts to recognize the context of an image and describe them in a natural language like English.

In this Python project, we will be implementing the caption generator using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) and LSTM (Long short term memory). The image features will be extracted from ResNet which is a CNN model trained on the imagenet dataset and then we feed the features into the LSTM model which will be responsible for generating the image captions.

For the image caption generator, we will be using the Flickr_8K dataset.

Flicker8k_Dataset – Dataset folder which contains 8091 images.


### DESCRIPTION:
•	Image caption generator generates caption for given input image. 

•	It deals with loading the saved model and weights to generate caption, where model has been trained on   several images with caption.
### 𝐎𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞:
1)	The goal of model is to loads image as input and generates caption. 

### 𝐓𝐨𝐨𝐥𝐬 𝐔𝐬𝐞𝐝 : 
•	Tools and Technologies used: Python, Numpy, Matplotlib, keras, cv2, pickle, CNN, LSTM.

•	IDE : Google Colab
